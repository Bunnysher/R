# Joker Simulation

**Overview:**
Is the Joker rigged? This question has been rising long-hour conversations in Greek cafeterias for years. Most Greeks believe in Joker conspiracy and they come to the conclusion that Joker is a scam; a conclusion rather rational for people who lack knowledge in respect to probabilities.    
But what is the Greek Joker? <br/>  
Joker is a game of chance that was introduced by the Greek Organization of Football Prognostics (OPAP) in 1997. Joker is a number game where the player is called to choose five numbers from 1 to 45 (no duplicates allowed) and one number (the joker) from 1 to 20. The lottery procedure is simple; there is a modern raffle box which contains 45 little balls that are tagged with numbers from 1 to 45. Firstly, five of those balls are drawn randomly from the raffle box and then 20 new little balls that are tagged with numbers from 1 to 20 are placed in the raffle box and only one is drawn randomly. If all six numbers on the player’s ticket match those produced in the official drawing (regardless of the order in which the numbers were drawn), then the player is a jackpot winner. Player’s tickets that didn’t match all 6 drawn numbers, but less, can still win prizes. The number of Joker lotteries that take place is around 104 lotteries per year.  <br/>  

**Overview:**
In this study, we answer to the aforementioned question by using simulation. Specifically, simulation is a way to model random events, such that simulated outcomes closely match real-world outcomes. Therefore, we attempt to simulate Joker, while assuming realistic scenarios, in order to see if many jackpots in a row are an expected outcome or an unnatural one.
